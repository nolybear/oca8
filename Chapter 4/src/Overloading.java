//	public int fly(int numMiles){} viewed as same as one above, only differst by return type, same variabbles so seen as the same method

	public void fly (short numFeet){}

	//varargs
//	public void fly(int[] lengths){} varargs treated as if were array, so both methods are the same
	public void fly(int... lengths){};

	//order for methods:
	//1 Exact match by type
	//2 Larger primative type
	//Autoboxed types
	//Varargs
